# Sample Notebooks

These notebooks contain code examples to help illustrate the basic workings of tensorflow. 

There are numbered notebooks which follow in their progression the outline of the talk. They should be looked at in order. 
There are also notebooks without any number, which explain and illustrate a very specific topic in more detail.

Please note that tensorflow is not optimally suited for the interactive format of jupyter notebooks. Especially the first notebooks that use global sessions and graphs are very fragile with respect to executing cells multiple times or out of order. If things stop working, please retry after restarting the kernel.
